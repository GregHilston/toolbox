Configuration Files
-----------------

Basic Config:
assignments.conf - Assign programs (by title or class name) to certain workspaces
exec.conf - Programs to execute on startup
keybinds.conf - Global keybinds (reenable media keys, etc)
header.conf - "Anything Goes"; basically this is the base conf file with some stuff removed or put in other files

Config for my i3 system:
modebinds.conf - Configuration on how to switch "modes" aka "workspace banks"

Template Configuration:
template_bankbinds.conf - Which keybinds should be included in each "bank"
template_monitors.conf - Which workspaces should be bound to which monitors
template_bank.conf - What a "bank" looks like; mainly just keybinds

Bank Setup:
banks/bank#.conf - The workspaces that belong in each bank


Scripts:
build.sh - Builds the whole config together based on your current installed monitors
replacer.sh - Internal script that does something related to bash templating


Instructions:
Put all of the other scripts I sent you into a folder in your PATH
Modify all of the basic config sections with your general i3-config preferences
Do the "bank setup" aka configure all of the banks you want
Do the "template configuration" so that workspaces are assigned to monitors, etc
Run ./build.sh
Every time you switch your monitor configuraiton, run ./build.sh
